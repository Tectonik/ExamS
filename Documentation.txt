Found bugs:
	* Fixed: Regardless of the request information, RequestProvider would make a new HttpRequest with a GET method, a "/" URI, and a HTTP version of 1.1
	* fixed: ActionDescriptor(now RequestComponentDescriptor) previously did not remove empty entries in the split items array, resulting in inconsistent behaviour
	* Fixed: In JsonActionResultWithoutCaching constructor used to exception for no without specified reason

Found bottleneck:
